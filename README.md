# Portfolio

This repo shows a bit of the work I did as an intern for Aentropico. It is published under authorization of the company.
These posts were part of the company's Datablog, an attempt to promote reproducible research in diverse subjects to make data-driven experiments Each blog consist of data cleaning and visualization code, as well as the raw and "tidy" data used. The posts were developed in R.

The repo holds the data, the cleaning for each of the databases and a descriptive, visual analysis, followed by a datastory.

The story.md holds the completed post with the data story. The details.md consists of the code chunks for the cleaning and visualization. You may find the HTML version of each of the posts here: http://rpubs.com/ireinstein

Further improvement and growth will be done to implement more analytical tools.
