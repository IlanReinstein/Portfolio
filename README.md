# Portfolio

This repo shows a bit of the work I did as an intern for Aentropico. It is published under authorization of the company.
These are blog posts used for the enhancment of the companyÂ´s business outreach. Each blog consist of data cleaning and visualization code, as well as the raw and "tidy" data used.

Topics range from economics to energy. 

Future improvements and details are needed.
