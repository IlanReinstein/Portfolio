# Portfolio

This repo shows a bit of the work I did as an intern for Aentropico. It is published under authorization of the company.
These are blog posts used for the enhancment of the companyÂ´s business outreach. Each blog consist of data cleaning and visualization code, as well as the raw and "tidy" data used.

Topics range from economics to energy. Some stories are written in spanish and others in english.
Two folders: one for the cleaning of the data for most of the posts. The other called posts holds the exploratory and visual code, as well as a story explaining the context and work done on the data.

Future improvements and details are needed.
