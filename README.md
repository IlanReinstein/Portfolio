# Portfolio

This repo shows a bit of the work I did as an intern for Aentropico as well as my submissions to the introductory Kaggle competitions. 

## Aentropico
Aentropico's blog posts are published under authorization of the company.
These posts were part of the company's Datablog, an attempt to promote reproducible research in diverse subjects to make data-driven experiments. Each report consist of data cleaning and visualization code, as well as the raw and "tidy" data used. The posts were developed in R with ggplot2, dplyr and RMarkdown among others.

The repo holds the data, the cleaning for each of the databases and a descriptive, visual analysis, followed by a datastory.

The story.md holds the completed post with the data story. The details.md consists of the code chunks for the cleaning and visualization. You may find the HTML version of each of the posts here: http://rpubs.com/ireinstein

Further improvement and growth will be done to implement more analytical tools.

## Kaggle

The Kaggle code is found on the titanic folder. The analysis can be found in the titanic.ipynb and it is work in progress. Further submission and improvement on the score are being development constantly yet not regulargly uploaded to this repo.
